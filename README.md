# Dependancies Library / Archive.

This is a collection of past dependencies, to be used as educational source material.

The purpose of this collection is to make it easier to source a number of commonly used past dependancies, rather than endless searching online.

Many of these are outdated and are no longer supported, some for good reason. Some may also not be stable to use at this present day.
