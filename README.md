# Dependancies Library / Educational Resources.

This is a collection of past dependencies, to be used as educational source material.

The purpose of this collection is to make it easier to source a number of commonly used past dependancies, rather than endless searching online.

Many of these are outdated and are no longer supported, some for good reason. Some may also not be stable to use this present day.

Remember it's good practice to double check 'Checksums' are valid for each, to ensure they are valid (safe as can be) releases.

Notes.
------
Double check you are using the correct dependancies for your compile.

It is good practice to cross reference required dependancies in the following files:

/contrib/gitian-descriptors/deps-win32.yml

/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian.yml

EXACT DEPENDANCIES ARE STATED UNDER 'files:' Section within these .yml files.
